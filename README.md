## What is NBA Stats Tracker

NBA Stats Tracker (NST) is a React based web-app that displays the statistics for any NBA player in a user-friendly way. NST uses an actively-updated API to get information on every NBA player, and every NBA game (1946 - current). You can search up a player's name, and see which team that player played for, and what his career statistics are. I am currently working on adding a visual element including charts to display stats, and allow users to compare multiple players.

## Dataset
I am using the public "balldontlie.io" api that provides access to every NBA game since 1946, and information on each player through a REST API.

This web-app is only possible due to this dataset, as all of the information that is being displayed is being pulled from the API.

## Final Words
I hope you have a great experience with NBA Stats Tracker. Right now, there are multiple features that I am continuing to work on, including adding interactive visual elements. If you would like any guidance on the code, or want to provide any modification, please reach out to me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-mehrotra-), or email me at adi1.mehrotra@gmail.com.
